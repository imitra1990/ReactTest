Test Case review
---------------

1) Forget to mock the fetch api calling.
    Every time we run the test case, it will call the actual api.
2) Negative test cases are missing
    i) If the api is Unable
    ii) If the given User id is not valid
    iii) If the User id is undefined
    iv) 404 not found api
3) Also valid response test is not done

4) Async testing are missing.
