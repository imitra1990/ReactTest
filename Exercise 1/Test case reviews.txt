Test Case review
---------------

1) Need to mock the fetch api to test the various test scenario.
    (When ever we run the test case, it will call the actual api. This should not happend)
2) Folowing negative test cases need to be handel
    i) If the api has any internal server error
    ii) If the given User id is not valid
    iii) If the User id is undefined
    iv) 404 not found api
3) Also valid response test is not done

4) Async testing are missing.
